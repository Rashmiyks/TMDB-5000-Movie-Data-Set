## Analysis of TMDB Movies Data {.tabset}

### Introduction

1. **Problem statement:** To analyze TMDB 5000 Movie data set obatined from Kaggle in order to provide insights into such as 
* Analyze trend over the years in terms of number produced, genres, runtime
* Most popular genres, spoken languages
* Top 10 movie producing countries and companies, Top 10 highest grossing movies of all time, Top 10 highest rated movies of all time
* How runtime varies across genres, original languages, countries, with gross and average vote, categorization of movies based on runtime
* How average vote has varied across years, original languages, different categories of movies 
* Difference in movies produced by different countries and production companies in terms of number produced, duration, gross revenue, etc.

2. **Approach:** 
* Preliminary analysis of data to see dimensions and stucture of data, number of missing and duplicate values
* Cleaning of data - removal of duplicate observations, spurious characters in title
* Data Manipulation - the data set has few columns in JSON format from which data has been extracted. The resulting data frames were joined to existing data set. New columns were created to store release year, gross (revenue - budget) and gross_flag (profit or loss).
* Data Visualization - Using ggplots, word cloud to visualize data

3. **How is it useful to consumers:** Primary objective of producing movies is to make profits. Some movies generate very high revenue while others go into loss. An analysis of movies will help understand how factors such as runtime, languages, genres influence revenue.

### Packages Required

**Packages used:**

* Dplyr     : For data manipulation 
* Jsonlite  : To extract JSON data
* DT        : To create data table so as to view data
* wordcloud : To plot a word cloud 
* Tidyverse : Tidyverse has several packages which makes it easy to install and load multiple tidyverse packages
* Ggplot2   : To visualize data using a variety of charts
* Lubridate : To extract year from release date
* Plotly    : To plot a 3D scatter plot

### Data Preparation {.tabset}

#### Data Source

Source of data is Kaggle - TMDB 5000 Movie Data set. 
You can find it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata/data)

The data set was created to answer different questions about movies such as what can be said about success of a movie, have certain production companies found a formula for success of a movie, why does a film with very high budget fail at box office and many more such questions. 

It contains 20 variables and 4803 observations across 88 different countries, 20 genres, 86 spoken languages.

Data Import code:

```{r}
movies <- read.csv("tmdb_5000_movies.csv", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

class(movies)
dim(movies)
colnames(movies)

colnames(movies)[4] <- "movie_id"    #Renaming id column as movie_id

```


#### Summary of Variables

The original data set has 20 variables and their data types are mentioned in brackets. They are as follows:

* Budget (dbl)               : Budget of a movie
* Genres (chr)               : Genre of a movie such as comedy, action, etc
* Homepage (chr)             : url of a movie
* id (dbl)                   : ID of a movie
* Keywords (dbl)             : Major keywords describing a movie
* Original_language (chr)    : Original language in which a movie was made
* Original_title (chr)       : Original title of a movie
* Overview (chr)             : Brief description of a movie
* Popularity (dbl)           : Popularity of a movie
* Production_companies (chr) : Names of the companies producing a movie
* Production_countries (chr) : Names of the countries producing a movie
* Release_date (dbl)         : Release date of a movie
* Revenue (dbl)              : Revenue earned by a movie 
* Runtime (dbl)              : Duration of a movie
* Spoken_languages (chr)     : Languages in which movie is available
* Status (chr)               : Status of a movie, if it's released, in production or rumoured to be produced
* Tagline (chr)              : Tagline of a movie
* Title (chr)                : Actual title of a movie
* Vote_average (dbl)         : Average vote received for a movie in IMDB
* Vote_count(dbl)            : Number of votes received by a movie

*Note: Original data set from Kaggle provides no information about unit of budget and revenue. I have assumed it to be in US dollars*

#### Original data set

Preview of first 100 rows of original data:

```{r}
datatable(head(movies, n = 100))
```


#### Data Cleaning

Missing Values:

There are several missing values in the data set. I have assigned NA to observations having blank, 0 and [] values. The number of missing cases in each column and total number of complete cases are as shown below:

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#Assign NA to blank values
movies[movies == ""] <- NA
movies[movies == "[]"] <- NA
movies[movies == 0] <- NA

sum(complete.cases(movies))

#Counting number of missing values in each column
movies %>% summarise_all(funs(sum(is.na(.))))
```

I am retaining all the observations for the analysis.

Duplicate Values:

Checking for duplicate movie titles using title column and removing the duplicate observations.

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#Checking for duplicate movie title and removing duplicate values
movies <- movies[!duplicated(movies$title), ]
dim(movies)
```

There were three duplicate rows and they were removed. 

Check for spurious characters:

Title column had spurious characters and they were removed during data cleaning.

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#Removing spurious characters from movie title
movies$title <- sub(pattern = "Â", "", movies$title)
```

Adding new columns:

Year is extracted from release_date column and stored in a new column. Extracting year will help in performing trend analysis. Also, new columns are created to store difference between revenue and budget and an indicator, gross flag, which tells if the movie has made profit or is in loss.

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
movies$year <- movies$release_date %>%
                    as.POSIXlt(tz = "", format = "%m/%d/%Y") %>%
                    year()

#Adding new columns gross and gross_flag 
movies <- movies %>%
  mutate(gross = revenue - budget, gross_flag = ifelse(gross < 0, "Loss", "Profit"))
```

There are five columns in the original data set which have JSON values. They have been extracted and store in separate data frames. Columns containing JSON values were dropped from original data set and new columns were joined to the final data set which has multiple values stored in one column separated by comma. 

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

```

#### Data Preview

Preview of first 100 rows of cleaned data:

```{r echo = TRUE}
datatable(head(movies, n = 100))
```

### Exploratory Data Analysis {.tabset}

#### Genre 
WordCloud was used for basic genre analysis. From the word cloud, it is evident that top five genres are Drama, Comedy, Thriller, Action and Romance in the order.

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#Function to count number of genres
number <- function(df, col) {
  df_count <- group_by(df, df[[col]]) %>%
    summarise(count = n()) %>%
    arrange(desc(count))
  
  names(df_count)[1] <- "df"                  #renaming column
  
  return(df_count)
}

genres_count <- number(genres1, 3)


#Generating word cloud
set.seed(42)
wordcloud(words = genres_count$df, freq = genres_count$count,
          random.order = FALSE, rot.per = 0.20, 
          colors = brewer.pal(8, "Dark2"))

```

Genre vs runtime - Looking at movies with runtime more than 200 minutes, we see that drama and history genres have more number of movies than any other genres. Animations and documentary genres have short movies. For rest of the genres, most of the movies are in regular category.

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
genre_df <- movies %>%
               select(movie_id, title, runtime, year, original_language, gross) %>%
               left_join(genres1, by = c("movie_id","title")) 

genre_df %>% 
  filter(!is.na(genres) == TRUE) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = genres, y = runtime)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))

```

Gross across genres and years: Heat map is used to see how gross varies across genres and years. Based on gross, popular genres across years include thriller, romance, mystery, horror, drama, adventure and action. Earliest movie belongs to drama genre.

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
genre_df %>%
  filter(!is.na(gross) == TRUE) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = genres, fill = gross)) +
  geom_tile() +
  ggtitle("Heat Map") +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Genre") +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "light blue", high = "dark blue") 

```

Genre vs Gross

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

genre_df %>%
  filter(!is.na(genres) == TRUE) %>%
  group_by(genres) %>%
  summarise(average_gross = mean(gross, na.rm = TRUE), movies_count = n(), total_gross = sum(gross, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  filter(movies_count >= 50) %>%
  arrange(desc(average_gross)) %>%
  head(n = 10)

```

#### Language 

The original and spoken languages are in ISO_639_1 codes. Their corresponding English names were found (source: https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php) and a new data frame was created. 

Bar chart and word cloud was used for basic language analysis. Top five languages in which movies were made include English, French, German, Spanish and Chinese. Note here that spoken language includes original language as well as language in which movies were dubbed.

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#Importing language file
language <- read.csv("ISO_639_1.csv", header = TRUE)
colnames(language) <- c("language_code", "Language")

colnames(spoken_languages1)[3] <- "language_code"

spoken_languages1 <- left_join(spoken_languages1, language, by = "language_code")

#Obtaining count of languages using function 
language_count <- number(spoken_languages1, 4)

#Wordcloud of languages
wordcloud(words = language_count$df, freq = language_count$count, 
          min.freq = 5, random.order = FALSE, rot.per = 0.25, 
          colors = brewer.pal(8, "Dark2"))
```
```{r}

#Bar chart showing top 20 spoken languages 
language_count %>%
  head(n = 20) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(df, -count), y = count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "blue") +
  coord_flip() +
  ggtitle("Frequency of languages") +
  xlab("Language") +
  ylab("Frequency")

```


In case of original languages:

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#Top 10 original languages in which movies are made
movies %>%
  group_by(original_language) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(count)) %>%
  head(n = 10)

```

Language vs gross
```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#Language vs gross revenue
language_df <- movies %>%
                 select(movie_id, title, runtime, year, gross) %>%
                 left_join(spoken_languages1, by = c("movie_id","title"))

language_df %>%
  filter(!is.na(Language.x) == TRUE) %>%
  group_by(Language.x) %>%
  summarise(average_gross = mean(gross, na.rm = TRUE), movies_count = n(), total_gross = sum(gross, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  filter(movies_count >= 50) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_gross)) %>%
  head(n = 10)
  

```

#### Runtime 

Average runtime of the movies over the years was analysed using scatter plot. We see that average runtime has come down over the years. after 1970, the average runtime has remained in the range of 100 to 125 minutes.

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

#Run time over the years
movies %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(avg_runtime = mean(runtime)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = avg_runtime)) +
  geom_point() +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Average Runtime")

```

Analysis of runtime across different languages is shown using boxplot and bar chart. The column 'original_language' was used for the analysis. Movies made in English language have an average runtime of around 110 minutes and several outliers were observed. Interestingly, the longest and shortest movies in the data set are also made in English language originally. Among the seven languages, which have average runtime of more than 125 minutes, most of them are Asian languages. in fact, two Indian languages - Telugu and Tamil, have average runtime of more than 150 minutes !!! 

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

#runtime vs original_language
movies %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = original_language, y = runtime)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  xlab("Original Language") +
  ylab("Runtime")
```
```{r}
movies %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = original_language, y = runtime)) +
  stat_summary(fun.y = mean, geom = "bar")

```

Based on runtime, the movies were categorized into short, regular and long movies. 

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

summary(movies$runtime)

#average movie length between 104 to 107 mins

quantile(movies$runtime, probs = 0.95, na.rm = TRUE)

quantile(movies$runtime, probs = 0.10, na.rm = TRUE)

#movies greater than 144 minutes are long movies. 95% of movies are shorter than 144 mins
#90% of movies are longer than 87 mins. So definig short movies as less than 87 mins

movies <- movies %>%
              mutate(Description = ifelse(runtime >= 144, "Long",
                                          ifelse(runtime <= 87, "Short",
                                                 "Regular"))) 


```

Gross vs categories of movies is shown using histogram. It is seen that highest grossing movies are long, followed by regular and then short.

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

#Gross vs Movie categories
movies %>%
  filter(!is.na(gross) == TRUE) %>%
  group_by(Description) %>%
  summarise(avg_gross = mean(gross),
           median_gross = median(gross))
```
```{r}

movies %>%
  filter(!is.na(gross) == TRUE) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = gross, fill = Description)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 200) +
  facet_wrap(~ Description, ncol = 1, scales = "free_y") +
  ggtitle("Histogram") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::comma)

```

3D plot of runtime vs average vote vs gross

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

plot_ly(movies, x = ~vote_average, y = ~runtime, z = ~gross/1000000, 
        color = ~gross_flag, colors = c('#BF382A', '#0C4B8E') ,size = I(3)) %>%
  add_markers() %>%
  layout(scene = list(xaxis = list(title = 'Average vote'),
                      yaxis = list(title = 'Runtime'),
                      zaxis = list(title = 'Gross (million $)')),
         title = "INTERACTIVE 3D Scatter plot: Average vote vs Runtime vs Gross",
         showlegend = FALSE)

```


#### Country 

Top 10 movie producing countries and number of movies produced by them

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#Count of movies by production countries
country_count <- number(production_countries1, 3)

#Top 10 production countries
country_count %>%
  arrange(desc(count)) %>%
  head(n = 10) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(df, -count), y = count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle("Top 10 movie producing countries") +
  xlab("Country") +
  ylab("Count of Movies")
```

Country vs runtime: Top 10 countries having longest average runtime. Only those countries have been considered which have produced atleast 50 movies. India has the longest average runtime of all countries.

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

Average vote of movies was analysed over the years and only movies which had more than 1000 votes were included in the plot. It is observed that average vote of movies was highest in mid 1960s, after which it has steadily declined.

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

#vote_average and vote_count over the years
movies %>%
  filter(vote_count >= 1000) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(avg_vote = mean(vote_average)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = avg_vote)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(stat = "smooth", position = "identity") +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Average Vote")

```

A look of how average vote varies across languages. Original language was used for the analysis.

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

#vote_average vs original_language
movies %>%
  filter(vote_count >= 100) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = original_language, y = vote_average)) +
  geom_boxplot()

```

Average vote vs gross across different categories of movies : It is seen that only a handful of movies have gross of over 1 billion dollars. Highest grossing movie belongs to long category but regular category has nearly double the number of movies with gross above 1 billion while there are no movies from short category in that range. We can also see that some movies have gross less than 0, i.e, the movies were in loss. Except a few movies, most of them with average rating above 7 have grossed less than 1 billion dollars. In fact, three regular movies with less than average rating of 7 have managed to gross above 1 billion dollars.

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

movies %>%
  filter(vote_count >= 1000) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = gross, y = vote_average, color = Description)) +
  geom_point(na.rm = TRUE) +
  facet_wrap(~ Description, ncol = 1) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::comma) 

```

#### Trend over the years

Analysis of movies over the years is shown using line plot. Year 2009 saw the highest number with 247 movies. It is seen that number of movies steadily increased till year 1999, after which there have been ups and downs. As the data set contains information about movies till 2016, We see a sharp decline in number of movies after 2015.

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

#Trend analysis of movies over the years
movies %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(movie_count = n()) %>%
  filter(movie_count >= 10)  %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = movie_count)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Number of Movies") +
  theme_classic()

```

Top 10 highest grossing movies of all time

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#Top 10 grossing movies
movies %>%
  select(title, gross) %>%
  arrange(desc(gross)) %>%
  head(n = 10) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(title, -gross), y = gross)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +
  ggtitle("Top 10 highest grossing movies of all time") +
  xlab("Movie Title") +
  ylab("Gross (in $)") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma)

```

Top 10 movies with highest rating. Only movies which have more than 1000 vote counts have been considered.

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#top 10 movies with highest rating
movies %>%
  filter(vote_count >= 1000) %>%
  select(title, vote_average) %>%
  arrange(desc(vote_average)) %>%
  head(n = 10) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(title, -vote_average), y = vote_average)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +
  ggtitle("Top 10 highest rated movies of all time") +
  xlab("Movie Title") +
  ylab("Average Vote")

```


### Summary

The points mentioned in problem statement were addressed in this project.

Functions in Dplyr package such as mutate, select, filter , arrange, sumarise, etc and jsonlite package were used for data manipulation, extracting data from JSON columns and creating new columns. For data analysis, various plots and charts such as scatter plot, bar chart, histogram, heat map, 3D scatter plot, word cloud, etc were used which were available in Ggplot, wordcloud and plotly packages. 

**Insights gained from data analysis are summarised below:**

* Number of movies produced has increased at a high rate after 1990, peaking at year 2009
* USA produces highest number of movies at 3955, which is significantly high compared to next country, United Kingdom
* Drama, Comedy, Thriller, Action and Romance are the top five genres as seen from word cloud 
* Animation and documentary genres have more number of short movies compared to other genres while history and drama  genres have more long movies, few of them longer than 200 minutes
* Earliest movie belongs to Drama genre. Genres such as Thriller, Romance, Mystery, Horror, Drama, Adventure and Action have been able to generate good gross revenue over the years
* Adventure, action genres are able to fetch very high gross revenue. Till date, they fetched over 100 billion US dollars
* In case of spoken langauges, i.e., the languages in which a movie is available, English is the most popular language for movies followed by French, German, Spanish and Chinese
* Average runtime of the movies has reduced over the years and now it is in the range 100 to 125 minutes
* Movies made in Asian languages tend to have higher average runtime than English language
* 95% of the movies have runtime less than 144 minutes. 10% of movies have run time less than 87 minutes. 
* Long movies (runtime more than 144 minutes) are the highest grossing movies followed by regular and short movies (runtime less than 87 minutes)
* Most of the movies which have grossed over 500 million dollars have an average rating of atleast 6
* Average gross revenue is highest in China, but overall gross revenue is highest for USA
* Average gross revenue is highest for Dune Entertainment company but overall gross revenue is highest for Columbia Pictures
* Interestingly, average gross revenue is highest for Latin language. However, English language has highest total gross revenue

**Implications:**
Based on above analysis, movies in the following categories might be able to fetch high gross revenue:

* Genres    - Adventure, Animation, Fantasy, Action
* Languages - English, French, German, Spanish, Chinese
* Runtime   - between 100 to 150 minutes

**Limitations and future work:**

* The project is limited to exploratory data analysis using plots and charts. Statistical analysis has to be done in order to make any conclusions.
* There could be more factors which influence gross revenue which have not been considered in the project.
* Modeling can be done and the data set could be divided into train and test data sets in order to verify the model.
